# Naïve Bayes Classifier from Scratch in Python
This repository implements a Naive Bayes classifier in Python. It implements the algorithm with Pandas library for data processing, but the Naive Bayes algorithm implemented from scratch without using off-the-shelf machine learning library.

# Dataset
Student dataset
* 649 instances
* 30 attributes
* 6 classes, corresponding to predicted final grade: {A+, A, B, C, D, F}
* [a relative link](data/student.txt) explains the attributes and class-labels
