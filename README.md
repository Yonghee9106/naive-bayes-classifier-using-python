# Naïve Bayes Classifier from Scratch in Pythoon
This repository implements a Naive Bayes classifier in Python without any machine learning library. It implements the algorithm with Pandas library for data processing, but the Naive Bayes algorithm implemented from scratch without using off-the-shelf machine learning library.
